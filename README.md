## Hactoberfest(October 1 to October 31, 2019)
### About
- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. 
- Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community.
- All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.
- You can sign in between October 1 to October 31, 2019 to participate and complete the challenge at [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
### Rules
- To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). 
- PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. 
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. 
- This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. (Last year 46,088 earned a shirt!)
